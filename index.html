      <p>Hi there and welcome to (the current version) of my portfolio.  I've been working at Amazon in Florence, NJ for four years and am currently trekking a path the hopefully leads to a whole new career.  In my current role I manage lost and defective virtual inventory in the fulfillment center using Excel, databases, and Quicksight. In 2021 I received a certification for completion of a 14 week data analytics fellowship through Correlation One where I learned data wrangling and interpretation as well as creating visualizations with Tableau and Google Data Studio.  Currently, I'm developing skills as java/full stack developer through the We Can Code It bootcamp.  For job offers and inquiries, please reach out through my Linkedin or Facebook profiles, provided below.</p>
